Test Plan:
- Check for the right number of arguments.
- Check for invalid input:
    1) check if all arguments are numbers (each position),
    2) check if Fibonacci number is within right boundaries: from 0 to 200,
    3) check if the number of threads exceeds 
the maximum number of threads allowed.
- Check if output of the program - the number of Fib() calls in each 
thread - is correct (manually):
    1) When fibMax = 5, the number of Fib() invokations has to be 33
    2) When fibMax = 4, the number of Fib() invokations has to be 18
    3) When fibMax = 1, the number of Fib() invokations has to be 1
- Check for the output when 
children don't have enough time to calculate all the 
Fib numbers 
(the number of invokations will most probably be different for each 
thread, since they did not have a chance to finish execution fully and were
terminated before)
